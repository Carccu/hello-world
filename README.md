# hello-world
Just for learning things

Hi! I'm a 36 years old woman from Finland who got into coding. I have been studying Python and also been fiddling around with Pygame. Loving it! 
I've been working with my own pygame project based on couple off Youtube tutorials just so that I learn to do stuff, maybe I'll create a new repository about it at here at some point if I get the hang of how this works! :D
